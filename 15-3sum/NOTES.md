3 Methods -
1. brute force
2. two pointer approach
fixing the first variable and reducing the problem into the two sum problem
now the only concern to this problem is to handle the dublicates
so we check for all three variables that they dont get repeated.
​
3. using hashmap
intuition
we can use hashmap for avoiding the duplicate element .
the last occurence of the element can be stored by the map as it only stores unique keys
